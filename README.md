# Mixed Number Calculator

Hi! This is my first project-ish thing that I even feel like sharing would be a good idea hehe~

So... this is a special calculator that deals *only* in __mixed numbers__

Mixed numbers are representation as `i.num/den` where `i` is the wholes, `num` is the numerator of the proceeding fraction and `den` is the denominator!
No decimals are supported! But you can omit a `.num/den` if you number you want to represent is not a fraction! (It'll work trust me!)

The operations supported are as follows
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplatication (*)
- Division (/)
- Powers* (^)

(Note: Powers are NOT PROPERLY SUPPORTED)

Negative numbers don't work... yet.

Uhhh... where do I get the GPL from hahaha...
